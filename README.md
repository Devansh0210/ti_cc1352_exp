# CC1352 Firmware

## Overview

This Zephyr application is being developed as a part of Google Summer of Code 2023. It removes the need to use GBridge (which is an userspace application) in the Beagleplay Greybus setup. 

This should be used in conjunction with [beagleplay-greybus-driver](https://git.beagleboard.org/gsoc/greybus/beagleplay-greybus-driver).
